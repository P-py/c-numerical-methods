# 📊 c-numerical-methods

> Repository for storing and versioning algorithms developed in C for the **Numerical Methods** subject at **Faculty of Engineering of Sorocaba (FACENS)**.

## 📁 About

This project contains implementations of classic numerical algorithms using the C programming language. Each method follows good programming practices and is structured to support academic learning, experimentation, and adaptation.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- [X] Root-finding methods (Bisection or Dichotomy)
- [X] Polynomial interpolation (Lagrange)
- [ ] Numerical integration (e.g., Trapezoidal Rule, Simpson's Rule)
- [ ] Linear systems (e.g., Gauss Elimination, LU Decomposition)

## 🔧 Requirements

- GCC or compatible C compiler
- Make (optional, for easier build process)

## 🚀 Compilation & Execution

### 🔹 Compile a file manually

```bash
gcc -o dichotomy ./dichotomy.c -lm
./dichotomy
```
